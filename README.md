# Quiz-Brawler
Game developed in order to test my networking skills in Unity.
Players join a lobby and then begin the game.
They are then presented with a quiz and you must answer as many questions (correctly) as possible.
After the quiz is over, you are able to use the points (earned from correctly answering questions on the quiz) to upgrade your character, or develop your aura.
After this, it is a fight to the death between all players in the lobby.
